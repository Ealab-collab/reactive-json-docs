# Demo components

This directory contains reactive-json components that are specific to
the demo website.

The components in this directory demonstrate one of the possibilities
to extend this library with custom components for your own applications.

The components are referenced by the components collection const `demoPlugins`
in `index.js`, and then injected into the ReactiveJsonRoot component
via the `plugins` props.
