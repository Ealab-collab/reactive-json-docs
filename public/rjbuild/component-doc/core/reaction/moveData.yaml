      # Reaction: moveData

      The `moveData` reaction changes the position of an element within an array in the global data context.

      ## Properties

      - `what` (string, required): The name of the reaction, which must be `moveData`.
      - `on` (string, required): The name of the event that triggers the reaction.
      - `path` (string, optional): The path to the array element to move. Required if `target` is not used.
      - `target` (string, optional): If set to `currentTemplateData`, the reaction will target the data associated with the current template item.
      - `parentLevel` (number, optional): Used with `target: 'currentTemplateData'`. Specifies how many levels to go up from the current data path to find the element to move.
      - `increment` (integer, required): The number of positions to move the element. A positive integer moves it down (towards the end of the array), and a negative integer moves it up (towards the beginning).

      ## Behavior

      - When triggered, `moveData` repositions an element within an array.
      - **Path Mode**: Identifies the element to move using its full `path`.
      - **Target Mode**: Identifies the element using `target: 'currentTemplateData'`, typically within a `Switch`.
      - The `increment` value determines the direction and magnitude of the move. For example, `increment: 1` moves the item one position down, and `increment: -1` moves it one position up.
      - The reaction has no effect if the target is not an array or if the move is out of bounds.

      ## Limitations

      - The target data must be an element within an array. The reaction will not work on objects.
      - An `increment` must be provided.
      - Moving an element past the beginning or end of the array has no effect (e.g., moving the first item up).

    title: "Moving an item in a list"
    description: |
      This example demonstrates how to move items up and down in a to-do list.
      Each item has "Up" and "Down" buttons that trigger the `moveData` reaction with an `increment` of -1 or 1.
