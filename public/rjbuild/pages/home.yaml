        # Reactive-JSON
  
        Welcome to the official documentation for **Reactive-JSON**, a powerful HTML builder library designed to create HTML with minimal JavaScript code and JSON (or YAML). This documentation will guide you through the installation, usage, and extension of Reactive-JSON.
  
        ## Overview
  
        **Reactive-JSON** is a React library developed by [EA Lab](https://ea-lab.io). It allows you to build websites or parts of websites using JSON (or YAML) configurations, which are processed by the Reactive-JSON engine. This approach significantly reduces the amount of JavaScript code needed to create complex HTML structures.
  
        ### Key Concepts
  
        - **HTML Builder**: Reactive-JSON acts as an HTML builder, enabling you to create HTML with minimal JavaScript code.
        - **JSON/YAML Processing**: The core of Reactive-JSON processes JSON (or YAML) to generate HTML, making it easier to manage and update your web content.
        - **Extensibility**: The engine can be extended with plugins, allowing you to add your own React components or integrate existing libraries like Chart.js.
