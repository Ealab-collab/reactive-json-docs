**Important**: These components are only available when using reactive-json-docs and are not included in the core @ea-lab/reactive-json package.

## Available Components

The documentation system provides specialized components for:
- **Code Highlighting**: Syntax highlighting for code examples
- **Documentation Layout**: Components for organizing documentation content
- **Interactive Examples**: Components for demonstrating Reactive-JSON features

## Usage Context

These components are designed for use in:
- Documentation websites
- Code examples and tutorials
- Technical content presentation
