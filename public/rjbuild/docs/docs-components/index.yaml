      # Documentation Components

      ## Overview

      This section documents components that are specific to the reactive-json-docs package. These components are not part of the core Reactive-JSON library but are provided by the documentation system to enhance the presentation of examples and technical content.

      ## Available Components

      The documentation system provides specialized components for:
      - **Code Highlighting**: Syntax highlighting for code examples
      - **Documentation Layout**: Components for organizing documentation content
      - **Interactive Examples**: Components for demonstrating Reactive-JSON features

      ## Usage Context

      These components are designed for use in:
      - Documentation websites
      - Code examples and tutorials
      - Technical content presentation
      - Educational materials

      They integrate seamlessly with core Reactive-JSON components and follow the same configuration patterns.
