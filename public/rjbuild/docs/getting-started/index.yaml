      ## Introduction

      Reactive-JSON is a powerful library that allows you to create interactive user interfaces using only JSON/YAML configurations. No need to write complex JavaScript code - simply define your interface and its behavior declaratively.

        content: |
          To get started with Reactive-JSON, install the package via npm and create your first configuration.
          
          The basic structure includes three main sections:
          - `renderView`: Defines what should be rendered
          - `templates`: Defines reusable templates (optional)
          - `data`: Defines the data to be used (optional)
    toDescribe:
      renderView:
        - type: div
          content: "Hello World!"
      templates:
        myTemplate:
          type: div
          content: "Template content"
      data:
        message: "Hello!"

      ## Key Concepts

      ### Template System

      In Reactive-JSON, you will often find those notations to access data:
      - `~.` : Local context (relative to current template)
      - `~~.` : Global context (access to global data)

      > ðŸ’¡ **Advanced navigation:** For complex hierarchical data access, see the [Template System documentation](/docs/getting-started/template-contexts-data-binding) which covers `~>key` and `~~>key` notations.

      - type: Markdown
        content: |
          This example shows how to use different types of data access in a template.
          The component accesses local data with `~.` and global data with `~~.`.
    toDescribe:
      templates:
        userCard:
          type: div
          content:
            - type: div
              content: ["Name: ", ~.name]
            - type: div
              content: ["Admin: ", ~~.isAdmin]
      data:
        name: "John Doe"
        isAdmin: true

      ### Basic Elements

      Reactive-JSON provides several types of elements:

      #### HTML Elements
      - Div, Button, Modal, Accordion, etc.

  - type: RjBuildDescriber
    title: "HTML Elements Example"
    description:
      - type: Markdown
        content: |
          Basic HTML elements like buttons and divs are easy to use.
    toDescribe:
      renderView:
        - type: button
          content: "Click me"

  - type: Markdown
    content: |
      #### Form Fields
      - TextField, SelectField, CheckBoxField, etc.

  - type: RjBuildDescriber
    title: "Form Fields Example"
    description:
      - type: Markdown
        content: |
          Form fields use `dataLocation` to bind data.
    toDescribe:
      renderView:
        - type: TextField
          label: "Username"
          dataLocation: ~.username
      data:
        username: ""

  - type: Markdown
    content: |
      #### Special Elements
      - DataFilter, Switch, Count, etc.

  - type: RjBuildDescriber
    title: "Special Element Example (Switch)"
    description:
      - type: Markdown
        content: |
          The Switch component is used to iterate over data collections.
    toDescribe:
      renderView:
        - type: Switch
          content: ~.items
          singleOption:
            load: itemTemplate
      templates:
        itemTemplate:
          type: div
          content: ~.name
      data:
        items:
          - name: "Item 1"
          - name: "Item 2"

      ### Actions and Reactions

      #### Actions
      Actions modify element behavior.

  - type: RjBuildDescriber
    title: "Action Example"
    description:
      - type: Markdown
        content: |
          Actions can be conditional, like hiding an element based on a condition.
    toDescribe:
      renderView:
        - type: div
          content: "Hidden content"
          actions:
            - what: hide
              when: ~.shouldHide
              is: true
      data:
        shouldHide: true

  - type: Markdown

      #### Reactions
      Reactions respond to user events.

  - type: RjBuildDescriber
    title: "Reaction Example"
    description:
      - type: Markdown
        content: |
          Reactions allow responding to events like clicks.
    toDescribe:
      renderView:
        - type: button
          content: "Save"
          actions:
            - what: setData
              on: click
              path: ~.saved
              value: true
      data:
        saved: false

      ## Complete Example

      Here's a simple example of an interactive form:

    description:
      - type: Markdown
        content: |
          This example combines several concepts:
          - Form fields with data binding
          - User event reactions
          - Data validation
          - Form submission
    toDescribe:
      renderView:
        - type: div
          content:
            - type: TextField
              label: "Name"
              dataLocation: ~.form.name
            - type: TextField
              label: "Email"
              dataLocation: ~.form.email
            - type: button
              content: "Submit"
              actions:
                - what: submitData
                  on: click
                  url: "/api/submit"
                  data: ~.form
                  when: ~.form.name
                  isEmpty: not
      data:
        form:
          name: ""
          email: ""
