      # AccordionItem

      The `AccordionItem` component is used inside a parent `BsAccordion` component. This parent is a React-Bootstrap Accordion adapted for Reactive-JSON, supporting templates and actions via the `BootstrapElement` system.

      **Important:** `AccordionItem` must be a direct child of `BsAccordion`.

      ## Properties
      - `header` (object, optional): Content for the accordion header
      - `body` (object, optional): Content for the accordion body
      - `attributes` (object, optional): Additional attributes for the Accordion.Item

          Click the headers to expand/collapse each section. Each section is an AccordionItem with its own header and body. The parent BsAccordion supports templates and actions.
