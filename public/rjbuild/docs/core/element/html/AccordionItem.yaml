      # AccordionItem

      The `AccordionItem` component is used inside a parent `BsAccordion` component. This parent is a React-Bootstrap Accordion adapted for Reactive-JSON, supporting templates and actions via the `BootstrapElement` system.

      **Important:** `AccordionItem` must be a direct child of `BsAccordion`.
