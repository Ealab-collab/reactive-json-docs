      # SortableTreeItemCollapseButton

      The `SortableTreeItemCollapseButton` component provides a collapse/expand button for tree items in a `FolderSortableTree`.

      Use this component when you want to customize the location of this button in the tree item.

      It's especially useful when the `manualDrag` option of the parent SortableTree is `true`, which causes the
      disappearance of the default collapse button.

      ## Properties

      None.

      ## Technical Details
      - Renders a button with CSS classes for styling.
      - Only appears when the tree item has children and supports collapsing.

          This example shows a `FolderSortableTree` with `SortableTreeItemCollapseButton` components in each item
          template. Click the collapse buttons to expand/collapse tree nodes.
    toDescribe:
      renderView:
        - # Inline style, because we want to style an element that is internally handled by the SortableTree lib.
          # It's better to put this in a CSS file or in the <head> though.
          # This code simply makes the item grow, and is needed only for a nicer presentation of the collapse button.

      ## Limitations
      - Only works within the template context of a `FolderSortableTree` item.
      - The button only appears when the tree item has children (`childCount > 0`).
      - No customization of the collapse/expand behavior beyond what the underlying SortableTree provides.
      - The styling is controlled by the dnd-kit-sortable-tree CSS classes. You will need to provide CSS to override
        the default styling.
