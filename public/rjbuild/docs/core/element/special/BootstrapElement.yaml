      # BootstrapElement

      The `BootstrapElement` component is an internal wrapper used by Reactive-JSON to integrate React-Bootstrap components into the template system.

      **You should not use this component directly in your rjbuild.**

      It is automatically used by higher-level components (such as BsAccordion, BsAlert, etc.) to provide Bootstrap features in a declarative way.
