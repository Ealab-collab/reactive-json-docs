      ## Example

      The following example will redirect the current page when the user clicks on the button.

      ```yaml
      renderView:
        - type: button
          content: "Go to EA Lab"
          actions:
            - what: redirect
              to: "https://ea-lab.io"
              when: ~~.allowRedirect
              is: "true"
            - what: setData
              on: click
              path: ~~.allowRedirect
              value: "true"
      ```

      ## Limitation
      - The redirection is immediate and replaces the current page.
