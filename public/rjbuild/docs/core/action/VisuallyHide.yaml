      # VisuallyHide

      ## Properties
      - None

      ## Behavior
      - The element is rendered in the DOM but with `display: none`.

          This example shows how the `visuallyHide` action makes an element invisible while keeping it in the DOM.
          
          Compare with the `hide` action: visually hidden elements can still respond to events and maintain their place in the DOM structure.

            - type: div
              content: "↑ Notice the space is preserved even when hidden"

      ## Limitation
      - The element remains in the DOM, which can impact accessibility or performance if overused.
