      # Reaction: redirectNow

      The `redirectNow` reaction performs an immediate browser redirection to a specified URL.

      ## Properties

  - type: DefinitionList
    content:
      - term:
          code: to
          after: "(string, required)"
        details:
          type: Markdown
          content: "The URL to redirect to. This value is evaluated, so it can be a static URL or dynamically constructed from data"

  - type: Markdown

      ## Behavior

      - When triggered, the reaction evaluates the `to` property to get the target URL.
      - It then sets `window.location.href` to the resulting URL, causing the browser to navigate to the new page.

      ## Limitations

      - The `to` property must resolve to a valid URL string for the redirection to work.
      - This action causes a full page reload, which will reset the entire application state.

      **Note**: Since this example performs a real redirection, clicking the button will navigate you away from this page.
