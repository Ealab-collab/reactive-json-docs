      # fetchData

      fetchData is a reaction that allows making HTTP GET requests to a server. It operates in two distinct modes:

      The behavior depends on `refreshAppOnResponse`:
      - If `true` (default): Response must be a valid rjbuild (with renderView/templates/data) as it will be used to re-render the application
      - If `false`: Response is completely ignored - useful for webhook-like calls or server notifications

      **Important**: Dynamic URLs are not supported. URLs must be static strings.

      ## Properties
      - `url` (string, required): The URL to call (must be a static string, dynamic URLs are not supported)
      - `refreshAppOnResponse` (boolean, optional): If true (default), the response must be a valid rjbuild and will replace the application state. If false, the response is ignored (webhook mode).

      ## Behavior
      - Only GET requests are supported
      - Only one request can be active at a time
      - The URL is evaluated via the template system before sending, but must resolve to a static string
      - If `refreshAppOnResponse` is true, the response must be a valid rjbuild and will replace the application state
      - If `refreshAppOnResponse` is false, the response is ignored (webhook mode)
      - Errors are only logged to the console
      - The triggering element is visually disabled during the request

          The basic structure of a fetchData reaction requires a URL and can include the refreshAppOnResponse option.

          The URL can be a template value that resolves to a static string.
    toDescribe:
      renderView:
        - type: button

          actions:
            - what: fetchData
              on: click
              url: "/mockup-api/fetchData/example.json"
              refreshAppOnResponse: true  # Response will replace the application state
        - type: div
          content:

          With `refreshAppOnResponse: false`, fetchData behaves like a webhook:
          - Response is completely ignored
          - Only the HTTP call is made
          - Useful for:
            * Server notifications
            * Triggering server-side actions
            * API pinging
            * Sending webhooks
    toDescribe:
      renderView:
        - type: button
          content: Notify Server
          actions:
            - what: fetchData
              on: click
              url: "/mockup-api/fetchData/status.json"
              refreshAppOnResponse: false  # Response is ignored, like a webhook
        - type: div
          content:
            - "Last call: "
            - ~.last_status
      data:
        last_status: "Not made"

          Errors are logged to the console but don't trigger a reload.

          The triggering element is visually disabled during the request.

          **Limitation**: No built-in error handling beyond console logging.
    toDescribe:
      renderView:
        - type: button

      ## Limitations

      - Only one request can be active at a time
      - Only GET requests are supported
      - Response must be a valid rjbuild **only** if refreshAppOnResponse is true
      - No built-in error handling beyond console logging
      - No support for request cancellation
      - No support for timeouts
      - **No support for dynamic URLs** - URLs must be static strings
      - No support for query parameters in URL templates
      - No support for complex URL routing or path generation

      ## Styling Fetching State (CSS)
      You can visually disable form controls during a fetchData request using CSS. The system is the same as for submitData:

      ### 1. Target only the fetching control (button, input, etc.)
      The element that triggered the fetch receives `data-is-submitting="true"` during the request:

      ```css
      input[data-is-submitting="true"],
      button[data-is-submitting="true"],
      select[data-is-submitting="true"],
      textarea[data-is-submitting="true"] {
        opacity: 0.5;
        pointer-events: none;
        cursor: not-allowed;
      }
      ```

      ### 2. Target all controls globally during fetch
      While a fetch is in progress, the `<body>` receives `data-html-builder-is-submitting="true"`. You can use this to disable all form controls:

      ```css
      body[data-html-builder-is-submitting="true"] input,
      body[data-html-builder-is-submitting="true"] button,
      body[data-html-builder-is-submitting="true"] select,
      body[data-html-builder-is-submitting="true"] textarea {
        opacity: 0.5;
        pointer-events: none;
        cursor: not-allowed;
      }
      ```

      Choose the approach that best fits your UX needs.
