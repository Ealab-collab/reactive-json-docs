      # submitData

      `submitData` is a reaction that allows sending data to a server via HTTP requests (usually POST). It's especially useful for form submissions and API interactions.

      - The payload can be customized with the `data` property.
      - Only one submission can be active at a time (global lock).
      - The response can refresh the app (default) or be ignored.

      ## Properties
      - `url` (string, required): The destination URL for the request
      - `httpMethod` (string, optional): The HTTP method to use (default: "post")
      - `data` (object, optional): The data to send. If not specified, data is sent in an object with the structure `{ data: globalDataContext.templateData }`. If `__state` exists in the context, it is automatically added.
      - `refreshAppOnResponse` (boolean, optional): If true (default), reloads the application with the server response. If false, the response is ignored and **no change is made to the application's state or display** (just like `fetchData`).
      - `submitSilently` (boolean, optional): If true, doesn't apply visual disabling styles during submission
      - `updateOnlyData` (boolean, optional): When true and `refreshAppOnResponse` is true, only updates the data section instead of replacing the entire RjBuild. Preserves templates and renderView. Default: false.
      - `updateDataAtLocation` (string, optional): When `updateOnlyData` is true, specifies where to place the response data using template path syntax (e.g., "~~.userProfile", "~.config.settings"). If not specified, replaces the entire data object.

      ## Behavior
      - Only one submission can be active at a time (global lock)
      - The default HTTP method is POST, but can be customized
      - The payload is either the provided `data` object or the full data context
      - Only the first level of the `data` object is evaluated as templates
      - The server response must be a valid rjbuild if `refreshAppOnResponse` is true
      - If `refreshAppOnResponse` is false, the response is ignored (webhook mode)
      - In case of an error, the submission is cancelled and logged to the console
      - Interface elements are visually disabled during submission (unless `submitSilently` is enabled)

      ## Submission States & Styling
      The system uses a global locking mechanism to handle submissions:
      - Only one submission can be active at a time for all application roots
      - New submissions are ignored while another is in progress
      - Interface elements are visually disabled (unless `submitSilently` is enabled)
      - The lock is released once the response is received

      This limitation is intentional to avoid data consistency issues but may be restrictive in some use cases.

      ### Styling Submitting State (CSS)
      You can visually disable form controls during submission using CSS. There are two main approaches:

      #### 1. Target only the submitting control (button, input, etc.)
      The element that triggered the submission receives `data-is-submitting="true"` during the request:

      ```css
      input[data-is-submitting="true"],
      button[data-is-submitting="true"],
      select[data-is-submitting="true"],
      textarea[data-is-submitting="true"] {
        opacity: 0.5;
        pointer-events: none;
        cursor: not-allowed;
      }
      ```

      #### 2. Target all controls globally during submission
      While a submission is in progress, the `<body>` receives `data-html-builder-is-submitting="true"`. You can use this to disable all form controls:

      ```css
      body[data-html-builder-is-submitting="true"] input,
      body[data-html-builder-is-submitting="true"] button,
      body[data-html-builder-is-submitting="true"] select,
      body[data-html-builder-is-submitting="true"] textarea {
        opacity: 0.5;
        pointer-events: none;
        cursor: not-allowed;
      }
      ```

      Choose the approach that best fits your UX needs.

      ## Example
      ```yaml
      actions:
        - what: submitData
          on: click
          url: "/mockup-api/submitData/example.json"
          data:
            username: ~.form_data.username
          refreshAppOnResponse: true
      ```

      ## Data Management
      Only the first level of the `data` object is evaluated as templates. For nested objects, you must specify the full path explicitly.

      Example:
      ```yaml
      data:
        username: ~.form_data.username  # Evaluated
        profile:
          name: ~.user.name            # Not evaluated (static)
          email: ~.user.email          # Not evaluated (static)
      ```

      If `data` is not specified, the entire `data` context is sent as `{ data: ... }`.

      ### __state Property
      `__state` is a special property that is automatically added to the payload when sending data if it exists in the global context. It allows transmitting the application state to the server.

      Example usage in a multi-screen form:
      ```yaml
      # State sent to server
      data:
        form_data:
          username: "john"
          email: "john@example.com"
        __state:
          current_screen: "step2"
          previous_screen: "step1"
          form_progress: 50

      # Server response
      data:
        form_data:
          username: "john"
          email: "john@example.com"
        __state:
          current_screen: "step3"
          previous_screen: "step2"
          form_progress: 75
          validation_status: "success"
      ```

      This bidirectional state synchronization allows to:
      - Validate that the progression is consistent
      - Adapt the response based on the current screen
      - Manage navigation between screens
      - Save progression state
      - Maintain consistency between client and server

      ## Data-Only Update Examples (@ea-lab/reactive-json@0.2.0)
      
      The properties `updateOnlyData` and `updateDataAtLocation` work identically for `submitData` and `fetchData`. 
       
       > **‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** When using `updateOnlyData: true`, the server response must contain **data only**, not a complete RjBuild structure. The response should be the raw data object, not wrapped in `{data: {...}, renderView: [...], templates: {...}}`.
       
       > **Since this documentation site only supports GET requests**, interactive examples for `submitData` cannot be demonstrated here. However, the behavior is exactly the same as `fetchData`.

      ### ‚û°Ô∏è **See Interactive Examples**

      Please refer to the **[fetchData documentation](/docs/core/reaction/fetchData)** to see fully interactive demonstrations of:

      - **Complete Data Replacement** with `updateOnlyData: true`
      - **Targeted Data Updates** with `updateDataAtLocation`
      - **Visual feedback** showing exactly which data sections change

      ### üîÑ **For submitData, the syntax is identical:**

      ```yaml
      # Complete data replacement after form submission
      actions:
        - what: submitData
          on: click
          url: "/api/user/save"
          data: ~~.formData
          updateOnlyData: true
          refreshAppOnResponse: true

      # Targeted update after form submission  
      actions:
        - what: submitData
          on: click
          url: "/api/user/save"
          data: ~~.formData
          updateOnlyData: true
          updateDataAtLocation: "~~.savedProfile"
          refreshAppOnResponse: true
      ```

      ### üí° **Common Use Cases for submitData:**
      
      - **Form submissions** that return updated record data
      - **Profile updates** that preserve application state 
      - **Configuration saves** that update specific settings sections
      - **Multi-step forms** where each step updates different data sections
 
      ## Limitations
      - Only one submission can be active at a time (global lock)
      - Only the first level of the `data` object is evaluated as templates
      - Only POST (or custom method) requests are supported
      - The server response must be a valid rjbuild if `refreshAppOnResponse` is true and `updateOnlyData` is false
      - When `updateOnlyData` is true, the response must contain **data only** (not a complete RjBuild structure)
      - No built-in error handling beyond console logging
      - No support for request cancellation
      - No support for timeouts
      - No support for dynamic URLs (URLs must be static strings)
      - No support for query parameters in URL templates
      - No support for complex URL routing or path generation
