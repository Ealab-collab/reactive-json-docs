      # Reaction: removeData

      The `removeData` reaction deletes data from a specific location in the global data context. It can operate in two modes: `path` mode or `target` mode.

      ## Behavior

      - When triggered, `removeData` deletes the data at the specified location.
      - **Path Mode**: Uses the `path` property to identify what to remove.
      - **Target Mode**: Uses `target: 'currentTemplateData'` to remove the current template data item from its parent array.
      - The reaction has no effect if the target data doesn't exist.

      ## Limitations

      - Either `path` or `target` must be specified.
      - With `target` mode, the data must be part of an array for removal to work.
      - Removing non-existent data has no effect (no error is thrown).

    description: |
      This example shows a list of users where each user can be removed by clicking a "Remove" button next to their name.
      The reaction uses `target: currentTemplateData` to identify which item to remove from the list.
