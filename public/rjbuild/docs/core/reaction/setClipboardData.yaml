      ## Behavior

      - When triggered, the reaction evaluates the `value` property.
      - If the evaluated value is a string, it uses the `navigator.clipboard.writeText()` API to copy it to the clipboard.
      - If the evaluated value is not a string, the reaction does nothing.
      - An error is logged to the console if the clipboard operation fails (e.g., due to browser permissions).

      ## Limitations

      - This reaction relies on the Clipboard API, which requires a secure context (HTTPS) to function in most modern browsers.
      - The user may be prompted for permission to access the clipboard, depending on browser settings.
      - The reaction only supports copying string values. Numbers and other types will be converted to strings, but objects and arrays will not be copied.
