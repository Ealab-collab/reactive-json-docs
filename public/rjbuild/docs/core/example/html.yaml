          HTML attributes are also supported.
          
          Attributes may be added through the `attributes` property. Assign a string
          value to each attribute.

            Inline styles have a specific structure. Instead of the string value, you must
            specify an object with the CSS property as the key, and CSS value as the value.
            Each key must be using **camelCase** instead of the usual hyphen-based CSS casing.
            
            In the following example, `backgroundColor` is used for the `background-color`
            CSS property.
