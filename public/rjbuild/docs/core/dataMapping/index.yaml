      # Data Mapping Components

      Data mapping components process and transform HTTP response data to specific locations in your application state. These components work with `fetchData`, `submitData` reactions, and `additionalDataSources`.

      ## Core Data Mappers

      ### [SimpleMapping](simpleMapping)
      The foundational data mapper that provides string-based mappings for selective data dispatch.

      - **Purpose**: Map HTTP response fields to application data paths
      - **Configuration**: YAML-based string mappings with destination templates
      - **Features**: Required fields, default values, error handling, update modes
      - **Use Cases**: User profiles, settings, API data transformation

      ## Creating Custom Data Mappers

      For information about creating custom data mappers and the broader Data Mapping system architecture, see the **[Data Mapping Documentation](../../advanced-concepts/data-mapping)**.
